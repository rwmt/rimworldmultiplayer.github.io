<h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h3 id="q-where-is-zetrith">Q: Where is Zetrith?</h3>

<p>A: No idea.</p>

<h3 id="q-how-can-players-connect-to-each-other">Q: How can players connect to each other?</h3>

<p>A: Players can connect through Steam, LAN, or Direct. To use direct connect, portforward 30502 through UDP or use a software like Hamachi.</p>

<h3 id="q-does-it-work-between-different-operating-systems">Q: Does it work between different operating systems?</h3>

<p>A: Currently everyone is cooperatively playing exactly the same game, with same maps, in the same faction. PVP is planned at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="q-can-mods-be-used-in-multiplayer">Q: Can mods be used in multiplayer?</h3>

<p>A: Yes, but not all mods will work in multiplayer. We have many resources for determining which mods work with Multiplayer. The best way to find out which mods work is looking at our <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Multiplayer-Spreadsheet">spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<h3 id="q-what-do-the-numbers-on-the-mod-spreadsheet-website-mean">Q: What do the numbers on the mod spreadsheet/website mean?</h3>

<p>A: 0 is untested, 1 is not working, 2 is major issue, 3 is minor issues, and 4 is no issues and working fine.</p>

<h3 id="q-what-is-save-replay">Q: What is save replay?</h3>

<p>A: A multiplayer save game.</p>

<h3 id="q-how-can-i-change-my-in-game-name">Q: How can I change my in-game name?</h3>

<p>A: Your name can be changed under Options &gt; Mod Settings &gt; Multiplayer &gt; Show Settings.</p>

<h3 id="q-can-i-play-singleplayer-with-the-mod-enabled">Q: Can I play singleplayer with the mod enabled?</h3>

<p>A: Yes, this should not cause any problems even with a lot of other mods enabled even if they are marked as incompatible.</p>

<h3 id="q-which-rimworld-version-should-i-be-using">Q: Which RimWorld version should I be using?</h3>

<p>A: Current Version.</p>

<h3 id="q-what-is-the-maximum-amount-of-players-that-can-be-in-a-game">Q: What is the maximum amount of players that can be in a game?</h3>

<p>A: We recommend 8 players max, but there is no hardcoded limit.</p>

<h3 id="q-can-i-make-a-dedicated-server">Q: Can I make a dedicated server?</h3>

<p>A: No.</p>

<h3 id="q-why-does-simulating-take-so-long">Q: Why does simulating take so long?</h3>

<p>A: Simulations takes place from the last autosave made, so if you do /autosave in chat before saving a replay or someone connects to your game it will speed up the simulation time. The same applies to resyncing, so if the host forces an autosave before someone resyncs it will also speed up their simulation time.</p>

<h3 id="q-is-this-mod-fully-vanilla-compatible">Q: Is this mod fully vanilla compatible?</h3>

<p>A: No, currently there are a few features that don&rsquo;t work in multiplayer. Faction renaming, and some caravan events are disabled.</p>

<h3 id="q-how-do-i-convert-a-multiplayer-game-back-to-singleplayer">Q: How do I convert a Multiplayer game back to Singleplayer?</h3>

<p>A: On the main menu click Multiplayer, select the save you want to convert and click watch. After watching it, select the time you want and click menu &gt; convert to singleplayer. It should show up in your singleplayer folder after that.</p>

<h3 id="q-how-to-clean-a-dirty-core-folder">Q: How to clean a dirty core folder?</h3>

<p>A: This can help you if you&rsquo;re having trouble loading Rimworld or in resolving Desync issues. Go to your Rimworld install folder &gt; Mods &gt; Core and delete the Core folder. Then, verify Rimworld&rsquo;s game files in Steam.</p>
