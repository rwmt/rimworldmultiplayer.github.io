The 1.1 update together with Royalty compatibility was a pretty tricky patch, as the update broke a lot of stuff and even now we&amp;rsquo;re still finding new things that need syncing/fixing. Anyway our &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; build will be uploaded to Steam &lt;em>sometime after this blog post is posted&lt;/em>, so have fun and report ANYTHING WRONG in our discord so we can fix it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Website Online</title><link>https://rimworldmultiplayer.com/post/19_07_31_websiteonline/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rimworldmultiplayer.com/post/19_07_31_websiteonline/</guid><description>&lt;p>We have a sorta-functional website now.
