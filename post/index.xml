      <title>Update 0.5.0 | 1.1 and Royalty Patch</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the radio silence and lack of updates. The 1.1 update together with Royalty compatibility was a pretty tricky patch, as the update broke a lot of stuff and even now we&amp;rsquo;re still finding new things that need syncing/fixing. Anyway our &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; build will be uploaded to Steam &lt;em&gt;sometime after this blog post is posted&lt;/em&gt;, so have fun and report ANYTHING WRONG in our discord so we can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Many thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PJB3005&#34;&gt;PJB&lt;/a&gt;, who suffered my many questions and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Silvertorch5&#34;&gt;Silver&lt;/a&gt; who helped me get things working in Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
