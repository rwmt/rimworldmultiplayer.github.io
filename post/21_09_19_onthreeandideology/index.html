<span class=author>Zetrith</span></span><p>Multiplayer has been updated to RimWorld 1.3 and the Ideology expansion by yours truly and the rest of the team.</p><p>Apart from supporting the base game features, with this update I took my time to fix Multiplayer&rsquo;s long-standing bugs and make some much-needed general improvements.
The highlights of this release:</p><ul><li>The mod mismatch screen has been refreshed</li><li>There&rsquo;s a new mod compatibility window</li><li>Improvements to the saving system</li><li>Desync stack tracing is now enabled by default and no longer marked experimental. The performance impact has been minimized.</li><li>Pausing dialogs (trading etc.) no longer block access to the map</li></ul><p>A fuller changelog:</p><ul><li>Updated to RimWorld 1.3 and Ideology (the only major feature not currently supported is the archonexus ending)</li><li>Pausing dialogs (trading etc.) no longer block access to the map</li><li>Mod mismatch screen has been refreshed</li><li>Ping other players on maps and the planet (Numpad 0 or Mouse 4 to ping, Mouse 5 or click alert to jump to pings)</li><li>New mod compatibility window, compatibility scores are now part of this window</li><li>Desync stack tracing is now enabled by default and no longer marked experimental. The performance impact has been minimized.</li><li>Desync info files are now smaller and more useful (they now contain host&rsquo;s traces and no longer include save files)</li><li>The game now waits until everyone is done saving</li><li>Autosaves are much faster (they no longer are full saves)</li><li>Autosave interval units: toggle between ingame days and realtime minutes</li><li>Any player can create a local full save now</li><li>Join points: created by host with /joinpoint, previously sometimes called full saves and done with /autosave</li><li>Auto join points hosting option: On join, On desync, On autosave</li><li>The &ldquo;Try resync&rdquo; button when desynced now rejoins instead of resimulating</li><li>Choose who can use dev mode: Host only, Everyone</li><li>God mode is now per player</li><li>Ransom demand events now work in multiplayer</li><li>Option to randomly suffix your username when joining a server and your name is taken</li><li>Added a notice when there are loading errors</li><li>Fix choice letters desyncing (wanderer joins etc.)</li><li>Fix the game sometimes freezing</li><li>Fix id errors after converting to singleplayer</li><li>Fix Royalty monument blueprint placing</li><li>Fix Royalty title renouncing</li></ul><p>User testimonials range from reporting incredible stability to desyncing every few minutes. The betas have been in development for some time now and I myself can vouch for the former but it&rsquo;s impossible to test across the vast array of setups y&rsquo;all might have. Please make your issue reports detailed and have patience as we work on making things even more stable.</p><p>Thanks to NotFood and Sokyran for their work on the Multiplayer Compatibility project, help with updating to 1.3 and testing.<br>Thanks to SaberShip for contributing code for the pausing dialog improvements.<br>Thanks to our staff for tirelessly answering your questions and managing the community.<br>And, last but not least, thanks to everyone who provided feedback on the beta releases.</p><p>If you have the means and would like to support the project, you can find links to our team members' donation pages at:
