      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have a sorta-functional website now. Much thanks to PJB, who patiently taught me a whole lot about web design in a very short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Patch v.0.4.6 | Protocol 15 Rimworld Multiplayer has finally been released on the Steam Workshop! https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1752864297
We decided to do this a bit earlier then planned because of several reasons
 A lot of people were having trouble installing the mod
 Updating the mod will be really easy for everyone
 Using outdated versions of the mod won&amp;rsquo;t be a problem anymore
 The next update of rimworld will break the mod for anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t update</description>
