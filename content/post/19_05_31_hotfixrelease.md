Rimworld 1.0.2282 broke the Multiplayer Mod. We fixed it.

## Hotfix

Rimworld 1.0.2282 broke Rimworld Multiplayer, because it implemented a load optimization that Rimworld Multiplayer already contained. This broke Rimworld Multiplayer, causing users to hard-crash to their home screen.

NotFood deleted the offending code and we got it reuploaded within a couple hours. Shoutout to Tynan himself for contacting us, offering his help if we needed it.
