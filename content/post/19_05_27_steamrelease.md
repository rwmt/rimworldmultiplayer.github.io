# Steam Workshop Release

Rimworld Multiplayer has finally been released on the [Steam Workshop!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1752864297) :D

We decided to do this a bit earlier then planned because of several reasons

* A lot of people were having trouble installing the mod

* Updating the mod will be really easy for everyone

* Using outdated versions of the mod won't be a problem anymore

* The next update of rimworld will break the mod for anyone who doesn't update

### Patchnotes

* Steam Workshop release

We've also been working on new bots to add functionality to the discord. Stay tuned.
