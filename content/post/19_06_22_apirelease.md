## API Release

Thanks to [NotFood](https://github.com/notfood) the API for Rimworld Multiplayer has finally been released with Update 0.4.8. Hopefully this will streamline the process for external mod creators to make their mods compatible with Rimworld Multiplayer.

The documentation for the multiplayer mod can be found [here](https://github.com/Parexy/Multiplayer/wiki/API).

## Mod Compatibility

Rimworld Multiplayer now has a separate multiplayer compatibility mod. In short, this mod is a collection of different patches for other mods to make them work with Rimworld Multiplayer. You can find a full list of which mods it patches on its [github page](https://github.com/notfood/RimWorld-Multiplayer-Compatibility)

Feel free to submit any patches you've made as PRs. They'll be reviewed and most likely added if they are functional.
