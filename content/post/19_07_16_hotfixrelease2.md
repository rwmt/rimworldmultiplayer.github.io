0.4.8.3 caused some issues with the research window not closing. We fixed it.

## Research Hotfix

0.4.8.3 was initially an API update. Unfortunately it caused some issues with the research window not closing so we rolled it back until we could fix it. It went live again a couple days after the bug was found. Sorry about that.
